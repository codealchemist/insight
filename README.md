### What's Insight?

It's a web application that gives you information about your Facebook account.

### Is it safe to use?

Absolutely! It doesn't store or share any information on its own.

### What information will it show me?

It will show some totals and nice graphics related to your Facebook account state and usage.

### Why is this useful?

Because it will let you learn more about how you use Facebook, with which people or groups you share the most, when and where you usually share, etc.
And the best thing is you'll see all this by taking just a quick look at some really nice graphics.
