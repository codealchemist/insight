    <h4>What's Insight?</h4>
    <p>
      It's a web application that gives you information about your Facebook account.
    </p>

    <h4>Is it safe to use?</h4>
    <p>
      Absolutely! It doesn't store or share any information on its own.<br>
    </p>

    <h4>What information will it show me?</h4>
    <p>
      It will show some totals and nice graphics related to your Facebook account state and usage.
    </p>

    <h4>Why is this useful?</h4>
    <p>
      Because it will let you learn more about how you use Facebook, with which people
      or groups you share the most, when and where you usually share, etc.<br>
      And the best thing is you'll see all this by taking just a quick look at
      some really nice graphics.
    </p>

    <h4>Are your kids on Facebook?</h4>
    <p>
      Then Insight will be extra useful for you. It will let you know how your kid
      socialize at a glance.
